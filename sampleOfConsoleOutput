Iteration: 1
Object detected
1.0 0.95022845 person
Calibration has correct count of person
Calibration for person has threshold: 0.9
Final threshold (65% of lowest object threshold): 0.5850000000000001
Time to do calibration: 0.0067596435546875
----Object Detection----
Default threshold 0.2 and will be set if not using calibration threshold
Recommend using default for un-organized objects or multi-object calibration
Use the calibration threshold: 0.5850000000000001? [y/n] y
Iteration: 1
